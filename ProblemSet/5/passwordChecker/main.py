Password Checker 🔐

Build a secure entry system. The user must type the correct password to get in.
If they get it wrong, let them try again until they get it right.

This project teaches:
- while loops
- input validation
- keeping things secure (sort of)

Let’s guard the vault!

# Example Input:
# Enter password: banana
# Incorrect! Try again.
# Enter password: secret123
# Welcome!

# Requirements:
# 1. Ask the user to enter a password
# 2. If it's incorrect, print error and ask again
# 3. Loop until they enter the correct password
# 4. When they get it right, print “Welcome!”

# HINT: Set a variable like correct_password = "secret123"

# TODO: Define the correct password
# TODO: Loop until the user gets it right
# TODO: Print welcome message on success
