Chatbot v1

Letâ€™s build your first interactive program â€” a simple chatbot!
It will ask the user for their name and respond with a greeting using their name.

This project teaches you how to:
- Use `input()` to get text from a user
- Store that input in a variable
- Use `print()` to build a friendly response

# Example Input:
# What's your name? Alice

# Example Output:
# Hello, Alice! Nice to meet you.

# Requirements:
# 1. Use input() to ask for the user's name
# 2. Store the result in a variable
# 3. Use print() to greet the user using their name
# 4. No f-strings or format() â€” just use string concatenation (+)

# TODO: Ask the user for their name using input()
# TODO: Print a friendly greeting using their name
