Ice Cream Order

You're working the counter at a virtual ice cream shop üç®!
Ask the user what flavor they want and how many scoops, then confirm their order.

This teaches:
- Multiple `input()` calls
- Variables and basic string operations
- Printing a sentence using those variables

Have fun taking ice cream orders!
