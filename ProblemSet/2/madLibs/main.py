"""
Mad Libs

Let’s make a silly story using user input!
You’ll ask for some words (like a noun, verb, or name), then fill them into a blank story template.

This helps you:
- Use multiple inputs
- Store and reuse variables
- Combine strings to form a sentence

Let your creativity go wild!
"""

# Example Input:
# Enter a name: Raza
# Enter a place: Mars
# Enter a thing: spaceship

# Example Output:
# One day, Raza flew a spaceship to Mars. It was awesome!

# Requirements:
# 1. Use input() at least three times (name, place, thing)
# 2. Print a full sentence using those inputs
# 3. Use string concatenation (no f-strings or format())

# TODO: Ask for a name
# TODO: Ask for a place
# TODO: Ask for a thing
# TODO: Print a story using those inputs
