"""
Compliment Machine 💬

This machine gives a random compliment to the user every time they press Enter!

This project teaches:
- random.choice()
- while loops
- lists and repetition

Let’s spread some kindness!

# Example Output:
# Press enter for a compliment (type "stop" to exit):
# You're awesome! 💪
# Press enter for a compliment (type "stop" to exit):
# You have a great smile! 😁
# stop
# Goodbye!

# Requirements:
# 1. Create a list of 5+ compliments
# 2. Use a loop that runs until the user types "stop"
# 3. On each Enter, randomly choose a compliment and display it
# 4. Say “Goodbye!” when exiting

# TODO: Import the random module
# TODO: Create a list of compliments
# TODO: Start a while loop that runs until "stop"
# TODO: Print a random compliment each time
