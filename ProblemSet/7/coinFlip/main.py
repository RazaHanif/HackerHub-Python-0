Coin Flipper ðŸª™

Simulate flipping a coin! Let the user flip as many times as they want, and show heads or tails.

This project teaches:
- random.choice()
- user input control loop

Letâ€™s flip!
"""

# Example Output:
# Flip the coin? (yes/stop): yes
# Result: Heads
# Flip the coin? (yes/stop): yes
# Result: Tails
# Flip the coin? (yes/stop): stop
# Thanks for playing!

# Requirements:
# 1. Use random.choice to randomly select "Heads" or "Tails"
# 2. Ask user if they want to flip again in a loop
# 3. Exit the loop if user types "stop"

# TODO: Import random module
# TODO: Write loop to keep asking until "stop"
# TODO: Flip and show result on each "yes"
