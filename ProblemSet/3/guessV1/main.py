Guess the Number v1

Let's play a guessing game!
Your program will have a secret number (hardcoded for now), and the user will try to guess it.
You'll respond with messages like “Too high” or “Too low” until they get it right.

This project teaches:
- Comparing numbers with if/else
- Converting input to integers
- Looping with a condition (optional if you want to make it 1 guess only for now)

Let's build your first game!

# Example Input:
# Guess a number: 3

# Example Output:
# Too low! (or Too high!, or Correct!)

# Requirements:
# 1. Hardcode a secret number between 1–10 (e.g., 7)
# 2. Ask the user to guess the number
# 3. Convert the input to an integer
# 4. If the guess is higher, say “Too high!”
# 5. If lower, say “Too low!”
# 6. If correct, say “Correct!”

# TODO: Set a secret number
# TODO: Ask user for a guess and convert it to an integer
# TODO: Use if/elif/else to give feedback
