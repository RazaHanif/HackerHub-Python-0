Countdown ⏳

Create a countdown timer that counts from 10 down to 1 — then says “Blast off!”

This project teaches:
- for loops that count backward
- working with the range() function
- sequencing with print statements

Let's launch a rocket!

# Example Output:
# 10
# 9
# 8
# ...
# 1
# Blast off!

# Requirements:
# 1. Use a for loop to count down from 10 to 1
# 2. Print each number on a new line
# 3. After the loop, print “Blast off!”

# TODO: Write a for loop that counts backward from 10
# TODO: Print each number
# TODO: Print "Blast off!" after the loop
