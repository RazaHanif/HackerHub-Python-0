Dream Journal ðŸ’¤

Create a program that lets users write down dreams they remember, then review them.

This project teaches:
- File I/O (writing and reading text files)
- User input and loops
- Basic persistence

Example Input/Output:
Enter a dream (or 'done' to finish): Flying over mountains
Enter a dream (or 'done' to finish): Swimming with dolphins
Enter a dream (or 'done' to finish): done

Your dreams:
1. Flying over mountains
2. Swimming with dolphins
"""

# Requirements:
# 1. Ask the user to enter dreams one by one
# 2. Stop input when user types 'done'
# 3. Save dreams to a file named "dreams.txt"
# 4. After input ends, read and print all dreams with numbering

# TODO: Open/create "dreams.txt" for writing
# TODO: Loop to get dreams from user and write to file
# TODO: After loop, open file for reading and print dreams with numbers
