Magic Door

Youâ€™re standing in front of three glowing doors: Red, Blue, and Green.
Each one hides a magical surprise (or a trap ðŸ‘€).

Ask the user to choose a door. Based on their choice, show them what they get!

This project teaches:
- Multi-branch if/elif/else
- Working with strings and input
- Basic user interaction

Time to open a portal to another dimension...
