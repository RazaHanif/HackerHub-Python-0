FizzBuzz

FizzBuzz is a classic coding challenge that tests your ability to use conditionals and modulus logic.

Here’s the challenge:
Ask the user for a number. If the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz".  
If it’s divisible by 5, print "Buzz".  
If it’s divisible by both, print "FizzBuzz".  
If it’s neither, just print the number.

This teaches:
- if/elif/else statements
- using the modulo operator (%)
- writing clean logic in order

Try not to overthink it — just take it step by step.

# Example Input:
# Enter a number: 15

# Example Output:
# FizzBuzz

# Requirements:
# 1. Ask the user to enter a number
# 2. Convert the input to an integer
# 3. Use % to check if divisible by 3, 5, or both
# 4. Print "Fizz" for 3, "Buzz" for 5, "FizzBuzz" for both
# 5. Print the number if it’s divisible by neither

# TODO: Ask for input and convert to integer
# TODO: Use if/elif/else to handle the FizzBuzz logic
