"""
Truth Teller ðŸ”®

Build a fortune teller! The user asks a yes/no question, and your program responds with a random answer like:
- Yes
- No
- Maybe
- Definitely not

This teaches:
- Random selection from a list
- String output variety
- Random responses using `random.choice`

Let your computer become the oracle!
